At this stage Warrick will be onsite each Tuesday to attend the Change Meeting as well as attend to tickets that have been logged in Marval.\r\n\r\nThe table below outlines how to contact/make requests for Oracle assistance. As you we will see all requests are to be logged as a ticket in Marval and severity 1 issues require contact to be made firstly by phone.\r\n\r\nDataSAM has been configured as a group in Marval with Warrick and Rick as members of that group. Rick has been configured as he is the backup to Warrick. When a ticket is logged for a request with respect to the Oracle environment you need to assign it to Warrick. Once a ticket has been assigned to Warrick and added or updated an email is automatically sent to support-pv@dataSAM.com.au, this is the main communication channel.\r\n\r\nDetails regarding response time and estimated fix times will be circulated shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeverity\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nWhat to do\r\n\r\nPrimary\r\n\r\nSecondary\r\n\r\nEscalation 1\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nComplete loss of a Production Service\r\n\r\nCall, then log a ticket\r\n\r\nWarrick Jackson\r\n0402 714 934\r\n\r\nRick Pian\r\n0414 319 436\r\n\r\nSDM David Morton\r\n0421 637 788\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nMajor disruption\r\n\r\nLog a  ticket\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nTask\r\n\r\nLog a ticket\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nLow severity task\r\n\r\nLog a ticket\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nEnhancement\r\n\r\nLog a ticket\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReference documentation\r\nTRIM # 06/57466  Marval configuration\r\nTRIM # 13/1652 Induction for Oracle Contractor\r\nTRIM # 13/2549 Oracle Contractor Transition Plan\r\nTRIM # 08/28192 Enterprise Architecture Places Victoria ICT Disaster Recovery and BCP Plan\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n1.

The Requester will receive a copy of the PO PDF via email once the Requisition has been approved and the Purchase Order assigned (the Requester can then forward the PO PDF or just the PO number as required).  An exception to this will be the stationery requisitions for Corporate Express (and Purchase Orders not originating from Requisitions), that will continue to be emailed / faxed to the vendor per the current process.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nLuisa\r\n\r\n ------------\r\n\r\nRecord Number	:	13/11232\r\nTitle	:	ICT Change Request - Oracle - Purchase Order transmission for iProcurement changes\r\n\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************************************\r\nThe information contained in this e-mail and any included attachments are confidential and intended solely for the named addressee and may be subject to legal or other professional privilege.
